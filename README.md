# Titanic-Survival-Predicative-Analysis-
Part two of Titanic machine learning using classification models to predict survival accuracy 

## Detial Description
I used various classification models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Logistic Regression, to predict survival on the Titanic dataset. After preparing the data, I trained each model and evaluated their performance using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports. This allowed me to compare their accuracy and identify which model best predicted passenger survival.
